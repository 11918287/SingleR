# Mouse

## ImmGen

The ImmGen database contains a collection of 830 microarray samples [@aran2019reference].
ImmGen raw expression data of phases 1 and 2 were downloaded as CEL files from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; GSE15907 and GSE37448), processed, and normalized using the robust multi-array average procedure on probe-level data using Matlab functions.
The analysis was performed using a custom CDF file obtained from Brainarray.

We classified 20 main cell types and further annotated to 253 subtypes.

## Benayoun

a data set of 358 mouse RNA-seq samples annotated to 28 cell types collected, processed, and shared, courtesy of Bérénice Benayoun, can also be used.
