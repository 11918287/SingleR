\title{Obtain human bulk RNA-seq data from Blueprint and ENCODE}
\usage{
BlueprintEncodeData(rm.NA = c("rows", "cols", "both", "none"))
}
\arguments{
\item{rm.NA}{String specifying how missing values should be handled.
\code{"rows"} will remove genes with at least one missing value, 
\code{"cols"} will remove samples with at least one missing value,
\code{"both"} will remove any gene or sample with at least one missing value,
and \code{"none"} will not perform any removal.}
}
\value{
A \linkS4class{SummarizedExperiment} object with a \code{"normcounts"} assay
containing the normalized expression values and cell type labels in the \code{\link{colData}}.
}
\description{
Download and cache the normalized expression values of 259 RNA-seq samples of
pure stroma and immune cells as generated and supplied by Blueprint and ENCODE.
}
\details{
This function provides normalized expression values of 259 bulk RNA-seq samples
generated by Blueprint and ENCODE from pure populations of stroma and immune 
cells (Martens and Stunnenberg, 2013; The ENCODE Consortium, 2012).

 Blueprint Epigenomics: 144 RNA-seq pure immune samples annotated to 28 cell types.
 ENCODE: 115 RNA-seq pure stroma and immune samples annotated to 17 cell types.
 Altogether, 259 samples with 43 cell types.

The samples were processed and normalized as described in Aran, Looney &
Liu et al. (2019); i.e. the raw RNA-seq counts were downloaded from Blueprint
and ENCODE in 2016 and normalized via edgeR (TPMs).

The data will be downloaded from ExperimentHub,
returning a \linkS4class{SummarizedExperiment} object for further use.
